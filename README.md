### Stock Market Monitor
write code in functional style using java.

This application is designed to retrieve the latest stock shares data for the current trading day by using Alpha Vantage API then return the stock with the highest price, with a value less than 500.  We will need to modify the code for APIFinance to account for the limitation of 5 API requests per minute and 500 requests per day.

### Trees, Trees, and More Trees
Rust: Tree data structure

There are currently two packages in the project, One is avl and the order is for redblack, each one containing their respective trees. When cargo run is called, a command line interface will be shown that prompts the user to either select a red-black tree or AVL tree. Afterwards, the user will be given a list of commands that can:
1. insert a node,
2. delete a node,
3. count the number of leaves in a tree,
4. return the height of a tree,
5. print in-order traversal of the tree,
6. check if the tree is empty,
7. print the tree showing its structure, or
8. exit the program.
Each command can be selected by inputting their respective number.
